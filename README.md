# Universal Scene Description (Rust)

IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: this crate is very experimental and in development. While
it intends to be a pure-Rust alternative to [bindings][usd-rs] to [Pixar's USD][USD],
currently it is entirely unfit to be used for that purpose.

- USD is a high-performance extensible software platform for collaboratively
  constructing animated 3D scenes, designed to meet the needs of large-scale
  film and visual effects production.

- USD provides robust interchange between digital content creation tools with
  its expanding set of schemas, covering domains like geometry, shading,
  lighting, and physics.

- USDâ€™s unique composition features have powerful benefits. For example,
  composition provides rich and varied ways to combine individual assets into
  larger assemblies, and enables workflows that let many users collaborate
  simultaneously without conflict.

For more information, we strongly recommend checking out [Pixar's documentation][USD].

usdr, by necessity, follows behind [Pixar's USD][USD]. Upstream is where
developments to the USD schemas and usda, usdc, and usdz formats are done.
Additionally, usdr does not aim to provide tools for manipulating USD, such
as Hydra; usdr is just concerned with interpreting the file format itself.
